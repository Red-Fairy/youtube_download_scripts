It began at age 14 when I wanted a career in the film and television industry and particularly in video editing. So I asked my father if I could borrow the video camera and the channel grew from there, videos here date back to 2006 but as technology improved I purchased a GoPro and an iPhone to make high quality content. When I got a job as a TV editor I never tried to make a living off my YouTube channel because I was already employed but since I moved to Qatar 🇶🇦 and currently working for Aljazeera I decided to put my two passions of traveling and editing on this YouTube channel. The latest high quality videos on this channel are travel guide videos to countries around the world such as Germany, Georgia, South Africa, Thailand, Mauritius, The Maldives and Qatar. When I travel to a new destination I always make a video journal of my adventure there to share with everyone across the globe.", "matchedVideoIds": [], "videos": [{"videoId": "57nfXxJf7eU", "title": "Final Cut Pro 7 || Tutorial || 120 FPS Footage  || 30 FPS Timeline  || 2017", "description": "https://linktr.ee/alexanderqkohler This video explains how to work with slow motion in Final Cut Pro 7.
