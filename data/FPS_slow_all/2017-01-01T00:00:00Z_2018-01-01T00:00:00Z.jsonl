We live in one of the most historic areas of Colorado, at about 8500 feet in the rocky mountains. Central City, CO. to be exact. We have spent most of our lives as professional photographers, computer gurus, and web site designers. We came to Colorado from Indiana in 2000 to expand our photography skills and business. We found it a very tight, local market here at that time. We moved on into computer and web services, where we made a good living for many years. We now own and operate the only all natural restaurant on the mountain. Burger Joint. Nothing from a box, can or microwave, is our motto. After semi retiring into the natural food business, we have decided to get back to our love of images. With our computer and technical background, combined with our photo and video skills, we though that areal imaging via UAV drones would be a perfect fit. Add this to a geographically spectacular location and here we are.
